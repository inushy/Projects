                            The feminine name Anushka in Sanskrit is used as a term of endearment, meaning "ray of light"
                            or "lightning". However, it is actually a variant of Annushka, which is a Russian diminutive 
                            of Anna. Anna is a version of the name Hannah, which was used in Latin and Greek back in the
                            Old Testament. The name Hannah is taken from Hebrew and means "grace" and "favour".

                            "Happiness is the experience of loving life. Being happy is being in love with that momentary 
                            experience. And love is looking at someone or even something and seeing the absolute best 
                            in him/her or it. Love is happiness with what you see. So love and happiness really are 
                            the same thing...just expressed differently." ~Robert McPhillips
