# 2A2V Welcomes You To Our Final Project! 

This is the group project for CSCI 466, in which we designed and developed an application using the tools covered in our class. The application we designed and implemented is a web-based, database driven tool to facilitate the running of karaoke events at a bar or other venue. It allows users to sign up to sing songs from the list of available songs, and also provide the DJ information needed to call up the next singer.
