# 2A2V Welcomes You To Our Final Project! 

This is the group project for 466, in which we will design and develop an application using the tools covered in our class. The application we will be designing and implementing will be a web-based, database driven tool to facilitate the running of karaoke events at a bar or other venue. It will allow users to sign up to sing songs from the list of available songs, and also provide the DJ information needed to call up the next singer.
