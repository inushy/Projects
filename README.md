About Me:

Hi Iâ€™m Anushka, a software engineer student at Northern Illinois University. 

From having a BA in Graphic Design to pursuing a BS in Computer Science, pivoting careers was a challenge that I was ready to embark upon. While learning Graphic Design, I got some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS which helped me gain interest in learning new coding languages. Being a Computer Science - Software Engineer Student helped get expierence with different languages such as C++, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS, Data Structures, etc. 

Therefore, I got the opportunity to apply my knowledge with these languages into my Assignments/Projects.
