### CSCI 340 - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

## Randomly Generated Integers

For this computer assignment, you are to write a C++ program to *generate random integers* in the range `LOW = 1`, `HIGH = 10000` and to store them in a `vector<int> v` of size `VEC_SIZE = 200`. Then, sort the contents of the vector (in ascending order) and display it on stdout.
