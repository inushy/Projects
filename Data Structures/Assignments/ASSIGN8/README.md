### CSCI 340 - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

# CS340 Binary Search Tree Class

For this computer assignment, implement a derived class (as a template) to represent a binary search tree. Since a binary search tree is a binary tree, implement your binary search tree class inherited from the base class of the binary tree that you implemented in your previous assignment.
